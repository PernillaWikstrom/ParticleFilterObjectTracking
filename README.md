# Visual Color Based Object Tracking Using Particle Filter
Abstractâ€” This paper presents results of the project in the
course Applied Estimation at KTH, Stockholm. The project
presents a method for visual color based object tracking using
particle filter. By pre-processing the data with help of a color
based RGB computer vision technique the filter tracks objects
through noisy scenes. Colors will be compared from frame to
frame for tracking. By using an arbitrary scene the motion
model is set to be Gaussian. Two sets of re-sampling methods
has been studied, multinomial and systematic. The result
verifies that the tracking algorithm has fulfilled its mission to
track an object in a video.

Keywords: computer vision; object tracking; particle filter;
